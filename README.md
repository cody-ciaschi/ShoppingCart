# ShoppingCart
This is a simple shopping cart application written in React that queries data from a Strapi database.

## Dependencies
- `Nodejs >= 14.20.1`
- `http-server >= 14.1.1`

## Usage
To use:
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to cartdb and type `npm start`. This will start the Strapi database.
- Navigate to  the top of the repo and type `http-server -c-1`.
- Click on `standalone.html`. This will bring you to the App.
- Have fun :)

## Future Improvements
I want to add use real pictures instead of random pictures. I would also like to restock a random amount of products rather than just adding what is currently in the database.
